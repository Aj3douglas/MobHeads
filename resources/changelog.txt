    Increase probability of heads dropping for all mobs. Instead of a MAX of 0.22% chance per head, you now have a 0.375% chance, coming close to the probability of default Wither skulls
    Increased probability bonus for all heads from 0.04% to 0.075%. Looting now makes more of a difference, while being close to matching base minecraft's head drop rate
    Fixed probability of bonus for Illusioners
    Added DEFAULT probability and probability bonus so you don't have to manually change all the entries if you want to make heads rarer/more common
    Fixed mob head drop achievements for Zombies, Skeletons, and Creepers, that would be able to drop their heads twice for charged creepers
